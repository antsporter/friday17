# Challenge 1

 - What was the challenge?
	To create and plan user stories for a cinema booking system small project
 - How I expected the challenge to go?
	I thought this challenge would be fairly simple as no coding involved bar the use 	of GitBash which I get on with quite well. I anticipated a bit of time while I 		overthought all the user stories before streamlining and making them make more 		sense.
 - What went well?
 - What didn't go as planned?
 - Possible improvements for future challenges.
